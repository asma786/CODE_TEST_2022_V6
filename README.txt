Code is messy and there is lot of room for improvement. 
1- We should use same name for data and for DB column names.
2- We should define rules instead of checking every field one by one in store method
3- Naming conventions should be followed properly
4- Code in BookingRepository class needs improvement on every line or we can say whole class need to be re written based on requirements
